# This project was typed without the use of AI except for the usage below:

Model used: ChatGPT

# AI was used to generate additional test cases for `TaskTest`.

The following is a code snippet of adjusted code generated by AI: 
```Java
@Test
    public void toTask_validNotDoneTask_success() throws Exception {
        Task expected = new Todo("Read book", false);
        Task actual = Task.toTask("T| |Read book");
        assertEquals(expected.toString(), actual.toString());
    }

    @Test
    public void toTask_validDoneTask_success() throws Exception {
        Task expected = new Todo("Read book", true);
        Task actual = Task.toTask("T|X|Read book");
        assertEquals(expected.toString(), actual.toString());
    }
```

# Observation:
* AI did not significantly reduce my time usage and its code had to be refactored because I only gave it a small snippet of code that shows the previous test cases.
